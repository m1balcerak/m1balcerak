# Michal Balcerak

Hello! I'm Michal Balcerak, currently pursuing my PhD in AI at the University of Zurich under the guidance of Prof. Bjoern Menze. My research focuses on inverse problems.

In addition to my PhD, I'm also a Fellow at Harvard University, where I'm working on inverse problems in biology and PDE-constrained optimization in Prof. Petros Koumoutsakos Lab. I also spent some time at CERN as a Student Researcher, where I was part of the ATLAS Experiment team and built a machine learning framework to identify collisions topologies at the LHC.

I'm always open to discussing ML, computational biology, and applied mathematics. Feel free to reach out to me!
